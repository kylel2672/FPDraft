Artificial Intelligence, is the ability when a computer has the intelligence of a human so
it doesn't need an human to operate it.

Like the car above, you've probably seen it commuting your way to whereever you go. It is a good example of AI, the AI helps you drive and even has a
autonomous safety system. It also has a smart summon, to make your car its way to you. This is also
a good example of the [positives of Artificial Intelliegence.](positive.md)

But there is also [negative effects of Artificial Intelligence](negative.md). There is military use of
Artificial Intelligence and also we may be too dependent on Artificial Intelligence. "Why?" you may ask, the
reasoning is because of hackers, they could easily sabotage us and threatened the lives of many or may even ruin
many lives.
