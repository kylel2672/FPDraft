Even though, Artificial Intelligence is helpful, it comes with negatives as well. Hackers can
take advantage of these technologies and easily sabotage them as well. Russia, is a country that has
good cyber technology. They are also know for alot of cyber attacks of America, as seen [here](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/13/russians-hillary-clinton-email-server-trump-indictment)
but that isn't the only attack. They are quite know for their cyber attacks and if they could hack these
technologies, then it will be really dangerous.

That isn't the only problem that AI causes, it also can take over jobs, Artificial Intelligence can
give the robot the ability to do things without humans. Meaning robots can make things with less
mistakes and also don't need hourly wages. Meaning loads could be jobless and poor, another negative effect
of Artificial Intelligence.
